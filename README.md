# Client-server authentication

The objective of this project is to create a server that requires clients to authenticate themselves through a shared key. Once a certain number of clients are connected, the server allows the download of an encrypted file.

## âœ… Completed
- Server-client part
- Secret key generation with /dev/urandom
- Checking client key once enough clients are connected
- Encrypted file: send + receive
- Tests: several clients, large files etc
- Script bash: test, clean, update

## Resume

Three cases:
- user tries to start the server without any argument: an error occurs

</p>


- user starts the server with a number of clients and this number is not reached: the server asks to the clients to wait for more clients to connect

</p>

- user starts the server with a number of clients and this number is reached: the server asks each client their secret key, checks it and sends an error if the key is wrong or sends an encrypted file if the key is right

## ðŸ”Ž Server-client

IO Multiplexing: chose to work with select().
[Advantage] : Portable solution, adapted to MacOS and Linux unlike poll() and epoll().
[Disadvantage] : Less optimized than poll() and epoll().

I referred to the IBM documentation to build my server and client and to Jacob Sorber's Youtube channel.

At each loop turn, only one call to select() is made. Only one send() and recv() is performed by the server and the client.

All data and functions members of the server class and client class are in private except for the launch functions.

If an error occurs, sockets are closed.

## ðŸ”Ž Client authentication

Key generator command: /dev/urandom.
[Advantage] : Easy to use.

The key is created when the run.sh script is launched and written in a .key file.

When the minimum number of connected clients is reached, the server asks the secret key to each of them and compares it with the key it holds in private variable.

If successful, the server proceeds to download the encrypted file.
In case of failure, the server will send an error message and ask for the secret key again.

## ðŸ”Ž Download encrypted file

Once encrypted by the server, the file ('encrypted.bin') is sent by the server through a socket, the client receives it, deciphers it and writes it into a file. The encrypted file generated by the server is also present at the root to show what content is being sent. Once written, the file is downloaded in at the root of the project and named 'decrypt.txt'. You can see the encrypted part in srcs/server/sendFile.cpp and the decrypted part in srcs/client/recvFile.cpp.

I found most of the answers to my questions about sending and receiving encrypted files on Stackoverflow and Youtube.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

```
bash run.sh
./server [minClientsNeeded]
```

In an other terminal, run one client

```
./client
```

To clean:
```
bash run.sh clean
```

To test:
```
bash run.sh test
```

Update:
```
bash run.sh up
```
